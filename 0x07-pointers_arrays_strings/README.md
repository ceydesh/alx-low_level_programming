1. 0-memset.c- a function that fills memory with a constant byte File
2. 1-memcpy.c- a function that copies memory area. It copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest and returns pointer to dest. File 
3. A function that locates a character in a string and returns pointer to the first occurrence of character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found. File 
4. A function that gets the length of a prefix substring. It returns the no. of bytes in the initial segment of s which consists only of bytes from accept. 
5. A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. It locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept and returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found.
6. 5-strstr.c- a function that locates a substring. It finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes(\0) are not compared. It returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring or NULL if substring is not found.
7. A function that prints the chessboard.
8. A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. Main.h is a header file with all prototypes for this directory.
