In this project I learnt more about nested loops and how they are run I also created the header file called main.h where I stored my C-header files. 0. isupper: Write a function that checks for uppercase character.



isdigit: Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9

Collaboration is multiplication: Write a function that multiplies two integers..

The numbers speak for themselves: Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

I believe in numbers and signs: Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Numbers constitute the only universal language mandatory Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line. Prototype: void.

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line: Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe: Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

You are so much sunshine in every square inch mandatory: Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

Fizz-Buzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Triangles: Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic: Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line

Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper: Write a function that prints an integer.
